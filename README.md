# Anti-GachaLife
Tired of relatives watching all that pathetic shit? Oh boy here's an easy solution for you! (and maybe your ears, too)

## Installation
 - Extract this repository in a convenient folder. (You can't delete this folder for as long as you want to use the extension. After all, you can't load an extension   that you have deleted.)
 - Open `chrome://extensions` in a new tab.
 - Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right.
 - Click the "Load unpacked" button that just appeared.
 - Select the folder where you just extracted the zip.

This is literally the stupidest thing i've ever made, but it works beautifully
